## Audit 1 - Landing Page

### ___Vision___
DaCeMo (Data-Centric Model) is an approach to modelling Enterprise as a set of OWL (Web Ontology Language) Ontologies. This project aims to build a website that displays a navigable, query-able, and understandable graph representation of a Data-Centric Model of an Enterprise. This is done to reduce the complexity of the modelling and provide a medium for both professional and unprofessional personel to understand the core concepts without an indepth knowledge of Ontology.

### Decisions
As decisions are an integral part of a projects success we have decided to document all decisions we make in Github Issues and populate a Decisions log with any major ones. Each decision will have a description into what it is, what we chose to do and why we chose that course of action.

More details can be found in our Decision Log [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1anLKNAmEHnaxctahnl2dxDmgxyedYRucJDIqQA2Wj6U/edit#gid=0) and under Issues, navigable from the top bar.

### Communications
For communications we have decided to hold team and client meetings for a minimum of 2 hours each week. These will be conducted on campus and will be used to consolidate what is required to be completed for the coming week. Outside of these in-person meetings the other mediums of communications used will be online meetings, through google hangouts, and conversation over Slack.

More details regarding communications can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WOyEloHzTXo1_0EDFdWRW22fTRUxw4OIF1i2ZqkQZ0s/edit#gid=0)

### Feedback
For feedback we have decided to treat each item of feedback provided with high regard and to discuss and decide whether to take action against the items during the weeks meeting following from when the feedback was given. Once we have decided what items should have action taken against them we will rank them in order of priority and slowly integrate them into the project.

Feedback Log can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hnrFNdFftAzHZiMPOrYj_A3DLYhC0CbpHIY28xZkoNc/edit#gid=0)
