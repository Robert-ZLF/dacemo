# DaCeMo Visualisation - Landing Page
A website that displays a navigable, query-able, and understandable graph representation of a Data-Centric Model (DaCeMo) of an Enterprise.

A complex domain made understandable to enterprise users from middle management, to IT, to CEOs, through varying layers of data abstraction. 

DaCeMo is an approach to modelling Enterprise as a set of OWL (Web Ontology Language) Ontologies. 

## CLIENT VISION
Present Data-Centric, Ontology-based, integrated, qualitative models of enterprise in a way that can be understood and navigated by untrained enterprise users. The model will contain:

* Explicitly modelled
  - Business Motivations
  - Business Processes
  - Business Capabilities
* Imported IT data
* Imported personnel data
* Imported Requirements, User Stories
