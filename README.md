# DaCeMo Visualisation - Landing Page

> Data-Centric Modelling (DaCeMo) is an approach to modelling Enterprise as a set of OWL (Web Ontology Language) Ontologies. However, the consumers of the models are not expected to understand OWL Ontologies.

## CLIENT VISION
Provide unifying, Data-Centric, Ontology-based integrated qualitative model of enterprise in a way that can be understood and navigated by untrained enterprise users. The model will contain.

* Explicitly modelled
  - Business Motivations
  - Business Processes
  - Business Capabilities
* Imported IT data
* Imported personnel data
* Imported Requirements, User Stories (in Spreadsheets)

## CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
* To deliver at least Iteration Zero (MVP).
* Honesty
* Communication Transparency
* Teamwork


## DELIVERING VALUE
### For Client
* Exploratory research into different ontology and graph presentation formats.
* Develop user-friendly, presentable Data Centric Modelling graphs. 
* A domain in which the information gathered by the modeller is traditionally explained to the end user in subsets (or not at all) is now clearly understandable to an untrained user. 
* With graphs that integrate Business and Technical knowledge, the Business/IT misalignment in traditional enterprise is narrowed.

## TEAM WORK
The team members are divided into two subteams to work on frontend and backend. 
However, these subteams will communicate regularly, as the format of data passed between these layers may change. 

## COMMUNICATION
1. We use Slack for day-to-day communication of development and issues that may arise.
2. We use email for meeting invitations, and communications that are especially important. 
3. We use Asana for assignment of tasks, deadlines, and task specification.
4. We use Skype/WeChat voice calls for members that cannot make it to our weekly meetings.
5. Face-to-face weekly meetings (Sundays) to communicate with Clients and present deliverables and issues. 

## PROJECT MILESTONE
Week | Goal
--- | --- 
3 | Implement and build solutions structure  
4 | Frontend must have the landing page, Open graph views
5 | Present top level concepts (Nodes only)
6 | Build graphs of top level concepts (Nodes and Edges from Top Level Concepts)
7 | Make graphs searchable and navigable 

Milestones/Goals are subject to change. 
 
## CONSTRAINTS
* Team members are inexperienced with Web application development process
* Some members are inexperienced with this domain.

## RISKS
* One of our team members is working remotely until 14th April. 
  * Mitigation strategies include clear meeting minutes and documentation, as well frequent (multiple times a week) virtual meetings.
* Client is a consultant for multiple unrelated projects - time between communications can be longer than anticipated. 
  * Mitigation strategies are still being researched by the team.
* The demand is not clearly defined (Severity: 2).
* The client's demand may change during development (Severity: 3).
* The data is dirty (Severity: 2).


## COSTS
* The project is open source and the potential costs (such as evaluating StarDog (a propietry knowledge graph software) and eventual hosting on an AWS server) will be covered by the client.
