## TEAM WORK
The team members are divided into two subteams to work on frontend and backend. However, these subteams will communicate regularly. 

## COMMUNICATION
1. We use Slack for day-to-day communication of development and issues that may arise.
2. We use email for meeting invitations, and communications that are especially important. 
3. We use Asana for assignment of tasks, deadlines, and task specification.
4. We use Skype/WeChat voice calls for members that cannot make it to our weekly meetings.
5. Face-to-face weekly meetings (Sundays) to communicate with Clients and present deliverables and issues. 

## PROJECT MILESTONE
Week | Goal
--- | --- 
3 | Implement and build solutions structure  
4 | Frontend must have the landing page, Open graph views
5 | Present top level concepts (Nodes only)
6 | Build graphs of top level concepts (Nodes and Edges from Top Level Concepts)
7 | Make graphs searchable and navigable 
 
## CONSTRAINTS
* Team members are inexperienced with Web application development process
* Some members are inexperienced with this domain.

## RISKS
* One of our team members is working remotely until 14th April. 
* Mitigation strategies include clear meeting minutes and documentation, as well frequent (multiple times a week) virtual meetings.
* Client is a consultant for multiple unrelated projects - time between communications can be longer than anticipated. 
* Mitigation strategies are still being researched by the team.

## COSTS
* The project is open source and the potential costs (such as evaluating StarDog (a propietry knowledge graph software) and eventual hosting on an AWS server) will be covered by the client.
