In this folder we use the available descriptions of the workings of the Ministry of Magic from the Harry Potter series. It is the place to try most outrageous ideas.

*We are researching to what degree we can keep such model in open access without violating J.K. Rowling copyright. It can be taken down without warning. Please, do not try to sell this model.*
